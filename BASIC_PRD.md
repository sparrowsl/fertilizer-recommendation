# üå± PRD: AI-Powered Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation Platform

## 1. Overview
Farmers often apply fertilizers blindly and grow crops unsuitable for their soil, leading to poor yields and wasted resources. This platform will leverage AI to analyze soil data and provide **personalized recommendations** for the most profitable crops and the optimal fertilizer mix.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Help farmers **increase yields** and **reduce input costs**.
- Provide **simple, actionable guidance** based on soil and climate data.
- Enable **NGOs, agronomists, and policymakers** to make better agricultural decisions.

---

## 3. Target Users
- **Smallholder Farmers** ‚Üí Primary users needing direct recommendations.
- **Agronomists & NGOs** ‚Üí Secondary users assisting farmers.
- **Government/Policy Makers** ‚Üí Use aggregated insights for planning.

## 4. Core Features
### MVP Features
1. **Farmer Input Form**
   - Upload soil test results or enter data (pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, moisture, organic matter, texture, location).

2. **Soil Data Analysis Engine (AI-powered)**
   - Detect nutrient deficiencies and classify soil type.

3. **Crop Recommendation System**
   - Suggest crops that thrive in the given soil + climate.
   - Rank crops by profitability potential.

4. **Fertilizer Mix Calculator**
   - Suggest custom NPK ratios.
   - Map recommendations to locally available fertilizer products.

5. **Reports & Guidance**
   - Generate clear, visual recommendations.
   - Provide step-by-step instructions in farmer-friendly language.
